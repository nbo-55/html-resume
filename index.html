    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I have been in the field of distribution, logistics, procurement and
      warehousing for almost thirteen years. started in 2005 while studying I
      became a spare parts shop employee who took care of all kinds of store
      needs, ranging from shopping for stock items until arranging deposits from
      sales. in 2009 through PT. Binayasa Karya Pratama, I had the opportunity
      to be a staff support for the logistics division of PT. Bank BTN
      Headquarters, here I know procurement of goods and services more broadly,
      ranging from building procurement until car drivers for management officer
      supply and household services.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2011 I moved to PT. Tirta Amarta, here I started to know in detail
      about warehousing, distribution and logistics. started as a warehouse
      staff for 2 years and became a warehouse supervisor until 2018. despite
      years of working in the logistics field, I also have an interest and
      attention in the world of information technology, and sometimes i get
      sidejob for web programming.
